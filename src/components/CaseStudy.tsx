      "A rapidly growing B2B SaaS company was struggling with design inconsistencies across their product suite. With 3 design teams working in silos, the design-to-development handoff was taking 5+ days, leading to missed deadlines and frustrated stakeholders.",

    title: "My Approach",
    content:
      "I led a 6-month initiative to build a comprehensive design system from the ground up. This included conducting a UI audit, establishing design principles, creating a component library in Figma, and collaborating with engineering to build a React component library with full documentation.",

    title: "Solution",
    content:
      "Nova Design System launched with 120+ components, comprehensive usage guidelines, and a living documentation site. We implemented a governance model with weekly design system office hours and a contribution process that empowered designers across the organization.",

    title: "Impact",
    content:
      "The design system reduced design-to-dev handoff time by 40%, improved design consistency scores by 85%, and enabled the company to ship features 2x faster. Designer satisfaction increased by 60% and developer NPS improved from 6 to 8.5.",
